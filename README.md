# goBirthday

goBirthday is a headless automation to wish you friends and loved ones happy birthday.


## Usage
  ### How it works

  create a config file at `$HOME/.config/goBirthday/config.json` before running.

  ### Example Config

  ```
  {
    "email": {USER LOGIN EMAIL}
    "password": {USER LOGIN PASSWORD}
  }
  ```

  running goBirthday will open a headless browser and automate the act of wishing everybody a happy birthday. By adding this as a cronjob to run everyday you can consistently wish all your friends and relatives a happy birthday without ever having to open facebook.
